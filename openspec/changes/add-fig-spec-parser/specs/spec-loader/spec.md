# Spec Loader Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Spec Registry

The loader SHALL provide a registry for accessing embedded completion specs.

#### Scenario: Get spec by name

- **GIVEN** binary contains git spec
- **WHEN** calling `SpecRegistry::get("git")`
- **THEN** git completion spec is returned

#### Scenario: Spec not found

- **GIVEN** spec for command `xyz` doesn't exist
- **WHEN** calling `SpecRegistry::get("xyz")`
- **THEN** None is returned

#### Scenario: Case-insensitive lookup

- **GIVEN** spec registered as `git`
- **WHEN** calling `SpecRegistry::get("GIT")`
- **THEN** git spec is returned

### Requirement: Lazy Loading

The loader SHALL deserialize specs only when accessed.

#### Scenario: Initial state

- **WHEN** SpecRegistry is created
- **THEN** no specs are deserialized yet

#### Scenario: First access

- **WHEN** spec is requested for first time
- **THEN** spec is deserialized from MessagePack

#### Scenario: Subsequent access

- **GIVEN** spec has been loaded once
- **WHEN** spec is requested again
- **THEN** cached version is returned (no re-deserialization)

### Requirement: Spec Validation

The loader SHALL validate specs during deserialization.

#### Scenario: Valid spec structure

- **GIVEN** well-formed MessagePack data
- **WHEN** deserializing spec
- **THEN** spec loads successfully

#### Scenario: Corrupted data

- **GIVEN** corrupted MessagePack data
- **WHEN** attempting to deserialize
- **THEN** error is returned with details

#### Scenario: Version mismatch

- **GIVEN** spec compiled with older format version
- **WHEN** loading with newer runtime
- **THEN** error indicates version incompatibility

### Requirement: Memory Efficiency

The loader SHALL minimize memory usage for large spec sets.

#### Scenario: Memory usage

- **GIVEN** 600+ specs available
- **WHEN** only 10 specs are accessed
- **THEN** memory usage reflects only loaded specs (not all 600)

#### Scenario: Cache size limit

- **WHEN** cache exceeds configured size limit
- **THEN** least recently used specs are evicted

### Requirement: Thread Safety

The loader SHALL support concurrent spec access from multiple threads.

#### Scenario: Concurrent reads

- **GIVEN** multiple threads requesting specs
- **WHEN** threads call `get()` simultaneously
- **THEN** all requests succeed without blocking

#### Scenario: First-load synchronization

- **GIVEN** two threads request same spec simultaneously
- **WHEN** spec hasn't been loaded yet
- **THEN** spec is loaded once and both threads receive same instance

### Requirement: Performance

The loader SHALL provide fast spec lookup and deserialization.

#### Scenario: Lookup time

- **WHEN** retrieving spec from registry
- **THEN** lookup completes in less than 1 microsecond

#### Scenario: Deserialization time

- **WHEN** deserializing average-sized spec
- **THEN** deserialization completes in less than 100 microseconds

#### Scenario: Cached access

- **WHEN** accessing previously loaded spec
- **THEN** access completes in less than 10 nanoseconds

### Requirement: Error Reporting

The loader SHALL provide clear error messages for failures.

#### Scenario: Missing spec

- **WHEN** spec is not found
- **THEN** error indicates which command was requested

#### Scenario: Deserialization error

- **WHEN** MessagePack deserialization fails
- **THEN** error includes spec name and failure reason

#### Scenario: Debug information

- **WHEN** verbose logging enabled
- **THEN** loader logs each spec load and cache hit/miss
